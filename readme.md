## Laundau Damping

Consider an applied electric field in a plasma. Particles moving at the same velocity as an applied electric field can remain in phase with it, and can gain energy from the wave as “resonant” particles. Fast moving particles are accelerated and decelerated equally by the oscillating electric field, so there is no net change in energy. Similarly, stationary particles (or particles moving slowly relative to the field) are also accelerated and decelerated, but there is no net change. 

Particles moving slower than the wave are accelerated, whilst those moving faster are decelerated. If there are more particles moving slower than the wave than moving faster, energy will be taken from the wave and it will be damped. This, in short, is Landau Damping.
